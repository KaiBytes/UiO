# UiO

Purpose of this directory is to store and put on display university projects I have finished so far. The directory will be continuously updated with more projects.
In the meantime, feel free to browse around. All projects listed here contain a pdf provided by the course which describes the project in .

### Planned changes

- add introduction describing what I am currently learning.
